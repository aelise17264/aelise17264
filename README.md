## Hi! My name is Anna Brander, I'm a versatile frontend developer with a strong passion for creating engaging and seamless user experiences across both web and mobile platforms. Utilizing tools in the Adobe Creative Suite I blend my technical expertise with creative design.

üñ•Ô∏è I'm a hard working and passionate Front End Developer with hands-on experience making significant, specific and self-motivated contributions to challenging cross-platform projects.  I'm currently looking for a position to apply creative problem-solving and collaborative skills as part of a team.

:thinking: If you're wondering "Why has her contribution activity dropped off?" That's because I've been diving into the Adobe Suite and learning how to do things like create original logos, informational videos and commericals. I'm having a lot of fun seeing what I can bring to life through tools like Adobe Illustrator and After Effects. But never fear, I'm still very enthusiatic about software development. This is just another tool in my utility belt that will help me create top of the line websites and apps.
